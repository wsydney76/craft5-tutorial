{# Pull in a template dynamically

Inside double quotes there is a string interpolation like this: #{expression}

The kebap filter converts a value into a better suitable filename here, e.g tableOfContents -> table-of-contents
#}

{# @param entry Entry #}
{# @param entries [Entry] #}

{% include "_partials/entry/special/#{entry.blockType.value|kebab}.twig" with {
    entries,
    entry
} only  %}
